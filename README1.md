# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the **price of used cars** based on various features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and other specifications.  
It uses machine learning techniques to analyze data and build a predictive model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Preprocessed the dataset (cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find patterns and correlations.  
- Built regression models to predict car prices.  
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **R² score, RMSE, MAE**.  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information about used cars such as:
- Model 
- vehicle_age
- Mileage  
- Fuel Type  
- seats
- Selling Price 
- transmission_type
- engine

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python   
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA & visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)  

---

## 📊 Results
- Trained regression models to predict used car prices.  
- Insights:  
  - vehicle_age and mileage strongly influence car prices.  
  - Fuel type and transmission also play a significant role.  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Use **deep learning models** for better predictions.  
- Deploy the model using **Flask/Django** or **Streamlit**.  
- Add more real-world datasets for robustness.
